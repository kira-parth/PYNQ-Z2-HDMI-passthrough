# PYNQ-Z2-HDMI-passthrough
This project implements HDMI passthrough functionality on the PYNQ-Z2 board, allowing you to:
  1.Receive HDMI input and pass it through to HDMI output
  2. Convert video signals to AXI4-Stream format for processing
  3. Integrate Test Pattern Generator (TPG) and Video DMA (VDMA)
      Process 1080p video in real-time
# You need ips ad this ip in vivado from this github https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ
# Vivado Block Design
  ZYNQ7 Processing System
First, set up the ZYNQ7 Processing System and run "Run Block Automation"â€”the default settings are sufficient.

Next, add the RGB to DVI Video Encoder and the DVI to RGB Video Decoder ip's.
# RGB to DVI Video Encoder
For the HDMI TX function, the serial clock is generated from the internal pixel clock and configured for 1080p.

# DVI to RGB Video Decoder
The DDC ROM offers preset resolution options, specifically the four resolutions listed below, and we also select 1080p.

# Clocking Wizard
Since the DVI to RGB Video Decoder's refclk requires 200MHz, we configured a 200MHz output using the Clocking Wizard.

# IP Connection
Next, we can proceed with the preliminary connections of the various IP cores and the configuration of the input/output ports.
